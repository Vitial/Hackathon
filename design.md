# Design — Vital Console & Workspace

A locked design system for this app. Every console/workspace redesign reads
this file before emitting code. Do not regenerate per page — extend or amend
this file when the system needs to grow.

Hallmark multi-page redesign · 2026-09-19
Genre: modern-minimal (Linear/Stripe school) on dark paper.
Macrostructure family: Workbench for all Console pages (rail + stream +
  inspector). The Workspace/chat is NOT a Console page and is exempt — it
  mirrors upstream Buzz and is locked to Buzz's own look (see "Two surfaces").
Nav: N3 side-rail. Top: N13 inline ⌘K-pill. No footer on app pages.
Enrichment: none on app pages — function carries the page.

## Two surfaces — do not blur them

This codebase renders two visually distinct surfaces, and they are separate on
purpose. Restyling one must never re-skin the other.

1. **Console** — Dashboard, Ledger, Approvals, Workflows, Governance, Activity,
   Requests, Claims, Audit, Rooms, Data, Learning, Compiler, Human work, Team,
   Account, detail pages, setup.
   Shell: `src/console/console-shell.ts` (`renderConsoleShell`, `vc-*` classes).
   Owns the design tokens, Outfit, the theme toggle, and the dark-glass brand
   default. Its chrome is drawn from the marketing brand system in `site/`
   (`vc-window` floating glass panels on the dot-matrix canvas, `v-wordmark`,
   `v-pulse-dot` eyebrow, pointer-tracked `v-spot` spotlight) and shares no
   class, id, or import with the chat shell.
2. **Workspace / chat** — the Buzz surface: room roster, per-room thread,
   Issues board.
   Shell: `src/console/workspace-shell.ts` (upstream Buzz classes
   `buzz-window`, `buzz-sidebar`, `buzz-top-nav`, `buzz-content-card`).
   **Locked to upstream Buzz.** Keeps Buzz's own near-white palette and its
   native font stack (`-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "SF Pro Text", …`),
   NOT Inter. No tokens, no `data-theme`, no theme toggle, no dark mode.

Why the chat is exempt: it is a faithful mirror of the real Buzz client
(`.upstream/buzz`, see its `VISION.md` — "Stream — Slack-like, fast"). Of the
chat's 47 literal colours, exactly one (`#FFFFFF`) coincides with a light-mode
token value, so tokenising it cannot be a no-op — it would change the chat's
look. That is why the chat is exempted rather than restyled.

### How the split is enforced

- `wrapInWorkspaceShell` in `serve.ts` branches once: `navKey === 'buzz'` → Buzz
  shell; every other nav key → Console shell. Chat is identified by nav key
  because that is the only place the two families differ.
- The chat path returns Buzz's document verbatim and does **not** call
  `themeDocument()`.
- `themeDocument()` (the `res.end` boundary in `serve.ts`) would otherwise
  inject the token block into every `text/html` response, and its `body` rule
  uses `!important` — which would re-font the chat from the system stack to
  Outfit and repaint its canvas onto the brand dot-matrix. `buzzDocument()`
  therefore carries `THEME_OPTOUT_MARKER`
  (`data-vital-no-theme`) in a `<head>` comment, and `themeDocument()` returns
  any document carrying it untouched.
- The marker is an HTML comment: it has no visual effect, so the chat's
  rendered output stays byte-identical to upstream aside from it.

### Macrostructure family

- Console pages: Workbench — left rail, center stream, right inspector. Pages
  vary only in stream content and inspector panels.
- Workspace/chat pages: Buzz's own two-column client layout (`buzz-sidebar` +
  `buzz-content-card`), exactly as upstream.
- Auth pages (login, signup, recovery): single centered card, no rail.

## Theme (dark-glass brand default, light opt-in)

Dark glass band, the palette the marketing entry points (`site/styles.css`)
ship, so home → signup → login → console is one continuous brand journey with
no visual hand-off seam. Display/body is Outfit (300–700, roman only); the
lime accent (`#D9FFA8`) and champagne (`#EAE4DC`) are kept from brand and used
sparingly. Light is an opt-in "paper" mode and mirrors the same token names, so
no component needs a second stylesheet or a theme branch.

Dark (default) — brand glass, mapped onto the console token names:

- `--v-bg-0`     #111111 — app canvas (dot-matrix painted over it)
- `--v-bg-1`     rgba(22,22,22,.82) — raised glass card
- `--v-bg-2/3`   rgba(255,255,255,.05/.09) — hover / inset wash
- `--v-ink`      #F3F3F3 — primary text; `--v-ink-strong` #FFFFFF
- `--v-muted`    #9A9A9A — secondary text; `--v-faint` #6A6A6A
- `--v-line`     rgba(255,255,255,.1) — hairlines
- `--v-accent`   #D9FFA8 — lime, actions + active states; `--v-accent-2` #EAE4DC champagne
- `--v-fact`     #9BE08C — verified / healthy
- `--v-hypo`     #E8C07A — pending / provisional
- `--v-risk`     #E87A70 — destructive / halted
- `--v-pred`     #8AA4D8 — predictions / info
- `--v-focus`    var(--v-accent) — 2px focus ring, instant, never animated

Light opt-in mirrors every name on paper (`--v-bg-0` #F7F8F6, `--v-accent`
#126B52 deep green, …) with the brand textures dialed down, so the same markup
renders as glass or paper purely from `data-theme`.

Brand texture tokens (both themes, dark = full strength, light = subdued):

- `--v-glass*` — panel fill, border and `--v-glass-blur` (16px) / `-sm` (12px)
- `--v-canvas-dots` — the dot-matrix `background-image` painted on `body`
- `--v-vignette` / `--v-spot` — the fixed `body::before` vignette and the
  pointer-tracked `.v-spot` spotlight (`--mx`/`--my` set by the shell script)
- `--v-grain-opacity` — the fixed `body::after` film-grain overlay (SVG
  feTurbulence data-URI, `mix-blend-mode: overlay`)

Token law (Console pages): every color and font-family in rendered output
references a `var(--v-*)` token. A needed value that has no token becomes a new
token first. Hex in comments is documentation, never paint.

Shared telemetry is decoupled from both shells: `ShellMetrics`,
`computeShellMetrics` and `computeRoomRecency` live in the neutral
`src/console/shell-metrics.ts`, so the console shell never imports the chat
shell (or vice versa) to draw a number. `test/routes.test.ts` budgets it under
the module key `console/shell-metrics`.

Chrome costs the same at ten rooms as at one. Every reading the rail and the
shell header need — room health (`ScopeHealthEvaluator.evaluateAll`), the room
set (`loadTenantRooms`), the budget gauges and the per-room recency — is a
grouped read over the tenant, never a loop of reads over its rooms. A new shell
reading that must run per room is a design error, not a measurement to update:
`test/routes.test.ts` renders `/console/rooms` before and after adding six team
rooms and fails if any shell module's statement count moves.

Scope exception — the Workspace/chat is exempt from the token law, not merely
non-compliant. Its literal Buzz hexes (`#1C1E21`, `#E8EAE6`, `#616061`,
`#DDDDDD`, `#2BAC76`, `#E01E5A`, `#ECB22E`, `#CD2553`, `#F8FAFC`, `#E2E8F0`,
`#0F5C57`, …) and its system font stack are the *locked* appearance. Do not
"fix" them into tokens: doing so changes the chat's look, which is the one thing
this system must not do. Changing them requires an explicit product decision to
re-skin the chat away from upstream Buzz.

Sentiment tints (per-theme pairs so pills read on both modes):

- `--v-tint-good-bg` / `--v-tint-good-ink`
- `--v-tint-warn-bg` / `--v-tint-warn-ink`
- `--v-tint-risk-bg` / `--v-tint-risk-ink`
- `--v-tint-info-bg` / `--v-tint-info-ink`
- `--v-tint-prose-bg` — review/approval evidence wash

## Typography

- Display: Outfit, 500/600/700, roman always (italic headers banned globally).
- Body: Outfit, 300/400/500.
- Mono: JetBrains Mono, 400/500 — ids, hashes, budgets, timestamps.
- H1 tight; H2 semibold; eyebrow 11px/600 uppercase tracked at .18em.
- Brand wordmark (`v-wordmark`): Outfit 20px/500, .25em tracking, `sup` ®.
- Display headers wrap: `overflow-wrap: anywhere; min-width: 0`.

## Spacing

4pt named scale: `--sp-1:4px --sp-2:8px --sp-3:12px --sp-4:16px
--sp-5:20px --sp-6:24px --sp-8:32px`. Radius (site-aligned): sm 8, md/input
10, lg 14, card 16, xl 20, pill 999.

## Motion (motion-cut project: no motion library)

- Easings: `--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.16,1,0.3,1)`.
- Hover: background/border shift ≤150ms; brand CTAs may lift with a
  compositor-only `transform` (translateY/translateX), never a layout property.
- Ambient: the eyebrow `v-pulse-dot` breathes on a 2.4s opacity loop; the
  `v-spot` spotlight tracks the pointer with no transition (rAF-throttled).
- Reveal: none. No layout-property animation anywhere.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` → transitions/animation ≤150ms, hover lift
  removed, and the ambient pulse disabled (`.v-pulse-dot{animation:none}`).
- Focus ring appears instantly.

## Microinteractions stance

- Silent success (inline status text, never celebratory toasts).
- Approve/decline: optimistic-disable + Undo-less explicit receipt link.
- Hover tooltips delay 800ms, focus tooltips 0ms.
- Buttons ship 8 states; `:focus-visible` ring ≥3:1, never animated.

## CTA voice

- Primary: filled accent pill, ink-on-accent label, one verb ("Approve",
  "Open queue", "Go to Chat").
- Secondary: hairline outline, muted label.
- Destructive: tint-risk wash + risk label, never filled red.

## Copy honesty (hard law, CI-enforced)

- Missing data renders `—`, never an invented number, name, or persona.
- No hardcoded `$` amounts, `%` telemetry, or UPPERCASE verdict badges in
  `src/console` or `src/talk` (fabrication guard + eslint twin).
- Raw protocol ids (`req_…`, `clm_…`, `usr_…`) never lead a line: humanized
  event cards first, full id in mono behind a link.
- `Signed in as <actor>` stays verbatim (browser-test contract).

## Rooms & categories

- Built-in rooms are fixed (13 canonical scopes). User-made rooms are created
  at `/setup/rooms` (id, name, scope, `*-agent` name, mission, category).
- Category is a closed set — `core`, `product`, `launch` — and picks the
  room's sidebar group in every shell. Roster rows and room headers show it
  as a chip. Unknown scopes 404 instead of rendering the wrong room.

## What pages MUST share

- Wordmark, teal accent ≤5%, Outfit + JetBrains Mono.
  (Typography was recorded here as Inter in an earlier pass. The rendered
  Console stack is Outfit, and `theme.ts` is the implementation source of truth
  — this section names intent, `theme.ts` names paint. Resolved 2026-09-20 per
  `redesign.md` §20 decision 9, so the redesign never reads two font stacks.)
- Rail + ⌘K-pill + theme toggle chrome.
- Card voice: 12px radius, hairline border, layered raise on hover.
- Review queue voice: count eyebrow, goal-first cards, evidence collapsed.

## What pages MAY differ on

- Stream content and inspector panels per tab.
- Department banners keep distinct hues via tint tokens only.
